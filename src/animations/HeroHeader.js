 * HeroHeader adds complex effect to its children components.

 *      <HeroHeader driver={driver}>
 *          <Image />

 *        <Title>Title</Title>
 *      </ScrollView>
 *    </Screen>
 * );

 * ...
 * Above code will create scroll dependent parallax animation over Image component
 * where image will be scrolled 1.5 times faster than Title and the image will have
 * a zoom in effect when the scroll reaches the top of the screen (on bounce)
